# DVD-Project-1 Stage 2

## Overview
Stage 2 of the project focuses on generating matrices of NMOS and PMOS stacks, each comprising two transistors. These stacks play crucial roles in digital circuitry, with 2-PMOS in the pull-up network and 2-NMOS in the pull-down network. By considering four input combinations (00, 01, 10, and 11) and maintaining a constant supply voltage (1.1V), we extract intermediate node voltages. This process provides essential insights into the behavior of these transistor stacks under different input conditions, aiding in understanding their functionality and performance.

## Directory Structure
- `NMOS_stack` directory: Contains netlist templates for NMOS transistor stacks consisting of 2 transistors and the output file generated by Ngspice simulations for varying input combinations.
- `PMOS_stack` directory: Contains netlist templates for PMOS transistor stacks consisting of 2 transistors and the output file generated by Ngspice simulations for varying input combinations.

## Results Overview
For each input case (00, 01, 10, 11), the simulation results for both NMOS and PMOS stacks are as follows:

### NMOS Stack
- For input case 00:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 7.954502e-02

- For input case 01:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 7.548177e-05 

- For input case 10:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 9.167810e-01 

- For input case 11:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 3.884222e-05
    
### PMOS Stack
- For input case 00:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 3.815347e-01 

- For input case 01:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 2.277686e-01 

- For input case 10:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 8.998845e-01 

- For input case 11:
  - Intermediate node voltage (v(x)): 3.884222e-05 

These values reflect the behavior of the transistor stacks under different input conditions. Parameters such as supply voltage (1.1V) and temperature (25Â°C) influence these outcomes.
